                     <p>I am a marketing pofessional carrying nearly ten years' experience in the field. I am passionate abou this industry because it allows me to use both my creative and analytical sides. I focus my career on generating campaign strategies that yeild an increase in brand awareness and lead generation. With a dramatic shift in marketing, success rides on digital efforts. Therefore, I have advanced my skills to include web design and web development to create sites that convert leads into customers.</p>
